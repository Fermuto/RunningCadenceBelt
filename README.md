# RunningCadenceBelt

Running cadence is the number of steps a runner takes per minute while running, commonly measured in strides per minute (SPM). It is a useful measurement for runners as it can provide insight into efficiency, form, and stride length. An ideal cadence for most runners typically falls into the range of 170 to 180 SPM although this is dependent on height and pace.

	Currently, there are already products on the market that can measure running cadence. For example, most “running watches” have cadence as an included measurement. However, it can be cumbersome for runners to constantly switch through display screens to monitor multiple data points at the same time such as pace, heart rate, distance, and cadence. Furthermore, unless a runner is running with their arm locked in front of them, continuous monitoring of cadence is impossible with a running watch. Other products take a different approach such as the foot-mounted ARION Footpod non-GPS 1.0 and Stryd. These products can track the cadence throughout the run in much the same way that a running watch would, but they can’t provide that information to the runner without the use of a watch or smartphone. In both the watch and foot-mounted solution, there is a lack of a product that provides easy, hands-free haptic feedback to the runner informing them when their cadence falls outside of the ideal cadence range.
